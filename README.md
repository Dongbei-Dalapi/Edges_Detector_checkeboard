# Edges Detector on checkerboard
The goal of this project is to detect the edges in a checkerboard and highlight them with a green line superimposed on the image.
## 1.1 Used tools
The project has been developed using Python and open source libraries. In particular it's been used:
* Python 3.7.3
* OpenCV 
* Numpy 
* Argparse 

## 1.2 Data
The *Data* folder include five pictures of chessboard. Each of them has different degree of noise and rotation.
